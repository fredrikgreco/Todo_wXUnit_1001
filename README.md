# Todo_wXUnit_1001

Created using standard settings for everything on github. Created a Project to link issues to and to build a board.
I ended up beeing forced to redo parts of this because of a computer crash, the crash completly corrupted atleast 1 push or pull request wich made my entire solution unable to open without crashing vissual studio, i have spent many hours manually recovering code from the project and rebuilding what was lost. This added the problem with how my board is not really reflecting the start times and pushes. I had to manually merge a few things because no matter what i have tried i haven't managed to fix the gitignore.
all my tests to use pull-request for merges has failed - same result every time.

I still have huge problems to use github since i forget to branch what i do. I usually work on many parts at the same time since im so use to code alone, i just switch focus when i get bored, this is not how to use github since then my branches gets very very "wide" and it's close to impossible to make head or tails from just looking at them what is added/removed etc.
I will do my best to learn to use issues as main tools for creating/modify code in separete branches.

The "app" here is a basic asp.net core with razor pages, i added a inmemDB (wich does close to nothing) just to have a way to make contexts and make it more fun to code. I am very aware it does almost the same as just using lists but I felt i wanted a DB but not a sql or some other that force the "user" to run a migration and/or "update-database" commands to make the app work.

i have tested the app on 2 computers and it runs on both so it should be done.

all tests pass when run
